# WISP Talk Africa Platform

[Routing System](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/file-conventions/route-files-v2)

## Style Guide Considerations

- Simple and responsive layout with minimum animation.
- At the top bar, menu links to our top products
- The search bar icon, when clicked should take up the entire menu until closed
  unless an omni-search feature is being used
- Under the header (top bar), we can have a small banner where we'd highlight
  pressing calls to attentions - policy changes, discounts, public notices like
  [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/)
- Use cookies to store client-side preferences: language, currency, date / time
  formats, etc..
- Locale settings should be available primarily at the bottom but could also be
  available at the top
- When implementing tabs, the selected tab should be specified in the url
  where practical
- When implementing modals, the active modal should be specified in the url
  where practical
- We need a facebook page
